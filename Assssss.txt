Over the past few months , I’ve consistently demonstrated HSBC’s core values. I secured 2nd place in the AWS DeepRacer competition, showcasing my ability to **get things done** and deliver results. I took **responsibility** in leading and contributing to three Selenium projects, where I learned to proactively solve problems, delivering solutions with precision. When i met ceo, I gained confidence and learned the importance of discipline and forward-thinking, always focusing on what can be done today rather than procrastinating. These values have fueled my ambition to one day step into a CEO’s role. I embrace **valuing difference** by collaborating with diverse teammates, listening to various perspectives, and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skill set. My ability to work in a constrained environment, particularly during my experience with HSBC, reinforces my commitment to **succeeding together**, as I believe great results come from working as a team. Looking forward, I aim to specialize in DevOps and continue to develop the capabilities needed to consistently deliver impactful solutions.
